Installation and setup
======================

Flickrsizer works best with RVM.

Flickrsizer uses Bundler to manage its dependencies.

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

Flickrsizer uses Foreman to manage its environment. Environment variables defined in a +.env+ file will automatically be loaded into the application by Foreman. The +.env.sample file+ defines the environment variables used by this application, use this to build your own +.env+ file
